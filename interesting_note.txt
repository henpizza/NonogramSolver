In the model_train.py file, you can change the range of data the model is trained on.
Interestingly, for large values of training samples, the accuracy is high, but the certainty becomes lower.
For example, for matrix of shape (5,5), we have the following approximate results for number of samples (num), for which the certainty is greater than 95 % (n), and the resulting accuracy (a):
    - num = 500 -> n ≈ 2 %, a = 1
    - num = 300 -> n ≈ 4 %, a = 1
    - num = 100 -> n ≈ 8 %, a ≈ 1
    - num = 30 -> n ≈ 10 %, a ≈ 0.8
